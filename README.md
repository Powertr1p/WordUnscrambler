# WordUnscrambler
Thats app was written for practice
A simple console application: Word Unscrambler

There is some words in Debug/wordlist.txt (rome, more, there, pass, cat, find, can, test, lux, word, hey, always, ordinary)
You can scramble one or multiple of those words and app will unscramble 'em and find matches.
Also, you can load scrumbled words from file (one word per line)

Thats all.
